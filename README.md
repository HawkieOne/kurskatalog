## Description

This is a repository where this [webpage](http://www.kurser.interaktion.nu/) is being rewritten in React. The old webpage was not up to date in terms of courses and does not have all the features that is needed. Therefore the goal is to make a total redesign of the webpage and add more functionality such as a more advanced exam builder than the current one. The layout is build with DaisyUI and TailwindCSS.

## Features

The features we want the webpage to have is:

- A new design that follows the color scheme of the Interaction & Design program
- An advanced exam builder
- Show which mandatory courses are needed for an exam
- Browse courses to find more information about them
